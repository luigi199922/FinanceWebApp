How to plot a option portfolio payoff diagram

1. We will create n arrays where n is the number of uniqued purchased options.
2. For each option, calculate is "payoff function" using a helper method (Depending on the type of option).
3. The length of each payoff array will be in the range o to 1.25 * maxStrikePrice.

Filling out the payoff arrays:

for Each of the payoff arrays
    evaluate the payoff function of the given option assign it to profit var
    if profit is greater than or equal to 0
        assign it to the current index
    else
        set the array index equal to zero

Sample array result: [20, 15, 10, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

After calculating the payoff arrays for each of the options

Calculate the cost which will be the sum of all of the strike prices times the # of purchased minus the premium revenue

add the payoff arrays and the cost to get the final data.
